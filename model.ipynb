analysis have show inconsistent result for eﬃ   cacy of second - generation   antidepressant . we therefore do a multiple - treatment meta - analysis , which account for both direct and indirect   comparison , to assess the eﬀ ect of 12 new - generation antidepressant on major depression . method we systematically review 117 randomise control trial ( 25 928 participant ) from 1991 up to   nov 30 , 2007 , which compare any of the follow antidepressant at therapeutic dose range for the acute treatment   of unipolar major depression in adult : bupropion , citalopram , duloxetine , escitalopram , ﬂ uoxetine , ﬂ uvoxamine ,   milnacipran , mirtazapine , paroxetine , reboxetine , sertraline , and venlafaxine . the main outcome be the proportion   of patient who respond to or drop out of the allocate treatment . analysis be do on an intention - to - treat   basis . finding mirtazapine , escitalopram , venlafaxine , and sertraline be signiﬁ cantly more eﬃ   cacious than duloxetine   ( odd ratio [ or ] 1·39 , 1·33 , 1·30 and 1·27 , respectively ) , ﬂ uoxetine ( 1·37 , 1·32 , 1·28 , and 1·25 , respectively ) ,   ﬂ uvoxamine ( 1·41 , 1·35 , 1·30 , and 1·27 , respectively ) , paroxetine ( 1·35 , 1·30 , 1·27 , and 1·22 , respectively ) , and   reboxetine ( 2·03 , 1·95 , 1·89 , and 1·85 , respectively ) . reboxetine be signiﬁ cantly less eﬃ   cacious than all the other   antidepressant test . escitalopram and sertraline show the good proﬁ le of acceptability , lead to signiﬁ cantly   few discontinuation than do duloxetine , ﬂ uvoxamine , paroxetine , reboxetine , and venlafaxine . interpretation clinically important diﬀ erence exist between commonly prescribe antidepressant for both eﬃ   cacy   and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline . sertraline might be the good choice when start treatment   for moderate to severe major depression in adult because it have the most favourable balance between beneﬁ ts ,   acceptability , and acquisition cost . fund none . introduction in the past 20 year , several new drug have be   introduce for the treatment of depression , many of   which be structurally related and share similar putative   mechanism of action . as with statin for the prevention   of coronary events,1 the extent to which these agent vary   in term of eﬃ   cacy and acceptability be unclear . moreover ,   some of the new drug be so - call I - too drugs2 — ie ,   chemically similar to exist drug with expire patent   rather than genuine advance in treatment . systematic   review have already highlight some diﬀ erence in   eﬃ   cacy between second - generation antidepressants.3–9 we report an overview of all randomise control   trial that compare 12 new - generation antidepressant   in term of eﬃ   cacy and acceptability in the acute - phase   treatment of major depression . we use multiple - treat- ment meta - analysis,10 also know as mixed - treatment   comparison meta - analysis or network meta - analysis ,   which allow the integration of datum from direct ( when   treatment be compare within a randomise trial ) and   indirect comparison ( when treatment be compare   between trial by combine result on how eﬀ ective they   be compare with a common comparator treatment).11   we aim to provide a clinically useful summary of the   result of the multiple - treatment meta - analysis that can   be use to guide treatment decision . method study selection and datum collection at the beginning of this project , we draft a study   protocol and subsequently make it freely available to the   public on our institutional website before carry out   the ﬁ nal analysis . furthermore , with the publication of   this paper the overall datum set will be in the public   domain . for our analysis , we include only randomise control   trial that compare any of the follow 12 new - generation   antidepressant   ( bupropion ,   citalo pram ,   duloxetine ,   escitalopram , ﬂ uoxetine , ﬂ uvoxamine , milnacipran , mirta- zapine , paroxetine , reboxetine , sertra line , and venlafaxine )   as monotherapy in the acute - phase treatment of adult   with unipolar major depression . we exclude placebo   group where present and randomise control trial of   woman with post - partum depre sion.12 to identify the relevant study , we review the   cochrane collaboration depression , anxiety , and neurosis   review group control trial register ( ccdandtr- study and ccdanctr -

generation antidepressant in the publish   literature , we use a modiﬁ ed version of a previously   publish classiﬁ cation describe by gartlehner and   colleagues8 ( table 1 ) . we employ this information to   detect inequality in dose that could aﬀ ect comparative   eﬃ   cacy , and use it in a sensitivity analysis by deﬁ ning   within the therapeutic dose only those study that use   comparable dosage within the predeﬁ ned range . statistical analysis we choose a dichotomous primary outcome mainly for   clinical reason . we use both the number of patient   who respond and the number of patient who   drop out to have hard outcome measure of both   treatment eﬃ   cacy and acceptability . we use response   rate instead of a continuous symptom score for eﬃ   cacy   analysis to make the interpretation of result easy for   clinicians.15 when dichotomous eﬃ   cacy outcome   be not report , but baseline score , endpoint   mean , and standard deviation ( sd ) of the depression   rating scale ( such as hdr or madr ) be   provide , we estimate the number of patient   respond to treatment at 8 week ( range 6–12 week )   range ( mg / day ) low medium high bupropion 150–450 < 337·5   337·5–412·5 > 412·5 citalopram 20–60 < 30 30–50 > 50 duloxetine 60–100 < 70 70–90 > 90 escitalopram 10–30 < 15 15–25 > 25 fluoxetine 20–60 < 30 30–50 > 50 fluvoxamine 50–300 < 75 75–125 > 125 milnacipran 50–300 < 75 75–125 > 125 mirtazapine 15–45 < 22·5 22·5–37·5 > 37·5 paroxetine 20–60 < 30 30–50 > 50 reboxetine 4–12 < 5 5–9 > 9 sertraline 50–200 < 75 75–125 > 125 venlafaxine 75–250   < 156·3 156·25–218·7 > 218·75 table 1 : dose classiﬁ cation base on low and upper dosing range   quartile 345 potentially relevant study identiﬁe for retrieval from literature search 98 article exclude after initial screening of title and abstract 27 additional reference 274 potentially eligible article retrieve with full text for more detailed analysis 172 article exclude after detailed screen 68 duplicate 11 meeting abstract ( unable to extract any datum )   39 non -

to - treat   basis : the analysis be base on the total number of   randomly assign participant , irrespective of how   the original study investigator analyse the datum . to   carry out a clinically sound analysis , we use a   conservative approach and impute outcome for the   miss participant assume that they do not   respond to treatment . first , we do pair - wise meta - analysis by synthesising17   study that compare the same intervention with a   random - eﬀ ect model18 to incorporate the assumption   that diﬀ erent study assess diﬀ erent , yet relate ,   treatment eﬀ ects.17 we use visual inspection of the   forest plot to investigate the possibility of statistical   heterogeneity , and the i2 statistic.19 we do the analysis   use stata version 9 . second , we do a random - eﬀ ect model within a   bayesian framework use markov chain monte carlo   method in winbug ( mrc biostatistic unit ,   cambridge , uk).11 we model the binary outcome in   every treatment group of every study , and speciﬁ ed the   relation among the odd ratio ( ors ) across study   make diﬀ erent comparisons.10 this method combine   direct and indirect evidence for any give pair of   treatment . we use p value less than 0·05 and   95 % cis ( accord to whether the ci include the null   value ) to assess signiﬁ cance , and look at a plausible   range for the magnitude of the population diﬀ erence.20   we also assess the probability that each antidepressant   drug be the most eﬃ   cacious regiman , the second good ,   the third good , and so on , by calculate the or for each   drug compare with an arbitrary common control   group , and count the proportion of iteration of the   markov chain in which each drug have the high or ,   the second high , and so on . we rank treatment in   term of acceptability with the same method . a key assumption behind multiple - treatment meta- analysis be that the analyse network be coherent — ie ,   that direct and indirect evidence on the same   comparison do not disagree beyond chance . to   estimate incoherence , we calculate the ratio of odd   ratio for indirect versus direct evidence whenever   indirect estimate could be construct with a single   common comparator . we deﬁ ned incoherence as the   disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with   a 95 % ci exclude 1 .   finally , we look at comparative eﬃ   cacy among the   12 antidepressant drug . we express these use   ﬂ uoxetine as reference drug , because it be the ﬁ rst   among these 12 antidepressant to be market in   europe and the usa , and it have be consistently use   as reference drug among the diﬀ erent pair - wise   comparison .   we do sensitivity analysis accord to the follow   variable : dose ( include only study within the   therapeutic range ) and imputation ( include only   study without imputation ) . to investigate the eﬀ ect of   sponsorship on outcome estimate , we carry out a   meta - regression analysis . role of the funding source no drug manufacturing company be involve in the   study design , datum collection , data analysis , datum   interpretation , write of the report , or in the decision to   submit the report for publication . all author see and   number   of trial year of publication country early median late europe north   america africa asia multiple   country bupropion 14 1991 2003 2007 1 10 0 0 2 citalopram 16 1993 2002 2007 4 4 0 1 4 duloxetine 8 2002 2006 2007 2 5 0 0 1 escitalopram 19 2000 2005 2007 5 11 0 0 2 fluoxetine 54 1991 2000 2007 15 13 1 3 6 fluvoxamine 11 1993 1998 2006 3 2 0 1 2 milnacipran 6 1994 2000 2003 2 1 0 2 0 mirtazapine 13 1997 2002 2005 3 3 1 1 5 paroxetine 32 1993 2001 2007 12 13 1 1 2 reboxetine 8 1997 2003 2006 2 2 0 0 1 sertraline 27 1993 2000 2007 10 9 0 2 1 venlafaxine 28 1994 2002 2007 7 5 0 1 6 the number of study across country in this table do not match the number of trial include in the review .   miss study score as other or not know . * two three -

eﬀ ect , toxic eﬀ ect , discontinuation symptom ,   and social functioning . however , the most important   clinical implication of the result be that escitalopram and   sertr aline might be the good choice when start a   treatment for moderate to severe major depression   because they have the good possible balance between   eﬃ   cacy and acceptability . we do not do a formal cost - eﬀ ectiveness analysis ;   however , because some new anti depressant be now oﬀ    patent and available in generic form , their acquisition   cost be reduce . indeed , only two of the 12 antidepressant   ( escitalopram and duloxetine ) be still on patent in the   usa and in europe . sertraline seem to be well than   escitalo pram because of its low cost in most country .   how ever , in the absence of a full economic model , this   recom mendation can not be make unequivocally because   several other cost be associate with the use of   antidepressants.138 reboxetine , ﬂ uvoxamine , paroxetine , and duloxetine   be the least eﬃ   cacious and acceptable drug , make   they less favour able option when prescribe an acute   treat ment for major depression . furthermore , in term of   acceptability , reboxetine be the least tolerate agent   among the 12 anti depressant and be signiﬁ cantly less   eﬀ ective than all the other 11 drug . therefore , reboxetine   should not be use as a routine ﬁ rst -

up   have be combined.139 a systematic review of clinical - trial   data140 that investigate early response to antidepressant   employ a common deﬁ nition of early response across   all include study . apart from this study , however , no   systematic review have investigate the comparative   eﬃ   cacy of antidepressant in individual with major   depression employ a common deﬁ nition of acute   response that include a predeﬁ ne follow - up duration . most trial include in our analysis do not report   adequate information about randomisation and allocation   concealment , and this might undermine the validity of   overall ﬁ nding . nonetheless , all study on antidepressant   include in this meta - analysis be very similar in term   of design and conduct , and the scant information in term   of quality assessment could be more an issue of report   in the text than real defect in study design , as it have be   commonly find in other systematic reviews.141 evidence exist of presence of sponsorship bias ( ie , the   bias associate with the commercial interest of   industrial sponsor ) in medicine,142 and there be concern   about the potential eﬀ ect of ﬁ nancial interest on medical   publication . because most study compare the   new antidepressant ( mirtazapine , escitalopram ,   buproprion , and duloxetine ) be do by the   pharmaceutical company market these compound ,   this might be a source of bias.143 some discrepancy   exist   between   some   of   the   result   of   the   multiple - treatment meta - analysis and those in the   direct comparison ( escitalopram vs citalopram and   mirtazapine vs venlafaxine ) . these ﬁ nding emphasise a   potential advantage of this analysis that incorporate   indirect and direct comparison , decrease the risk for   possible sponsorship bias . however , limitation of the   primary trial and potential confounder ( such as dose   issue ) can aﬀ ect the validity of the ﬁ nding . reader   can not fully appreciate the meaning of a study without   acknowledge the bias in the design and interpretation   that can arise when a sponsor might beneﬁ t from a study   publication.144 such association should be make clear to   let anyone judge the relevance of ﬁ nding . placebo - control trial be require to adequately   assess the eﬃ   cacy of novel antidepressant drugs.145 in   both the usa and europe , regulatory authority require   placebo - control study for marketing authorisation .   the   selective   publication   of   placebo - control   antidepressant trial and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ   cacy be   well recognised146 and there be currently controversy on   this topic 147 placebo - control trial be mainly design   for regulatory approval purpose ; to meet both ethical   and safety requirement , they tend to recruit patient   with a mild form of disease.148 although placebo - control   trial can be eﬃ   cient because they need small sample   size than non - placebo - control trial , diﬃ   cultie in   carry out these trial when eﬀ ective treatment be   know to exist can introduce artifact into clinical   trials.149 response to placebo across antidepressant trial have   be show to vary and have clearly increase in the past   two decade , with a similar increase occur in the   fraction of patient respond to active medication as   well.150 the issue of change in trial outcome over time be   still under debate;151 however , the change in placebo   response do not seem to be directly explain by change   in study characteristics.150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity , for   example , be likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in   placebo response rate , which increase the proportion of   fail trials.150 as placebo - control trial of antidepressant   become increasingly diﬃ   cult to do , it be perhaps time to   reconsider the standard requirement . our analysis   suggest that sertraline be well than other new - generation   drug in term of eﬃ   cacy and acceptability , and could be   use as a standard comparator in phase iii and also in   pragmatic ( or eﬀ ectiveness ) trial to increase the real - world   applicability of the result . although the sample - size   requirement might be large than in the ideal   placebo - control   trial ,   the   increase   real - world   applicability of the result would , in our opinion , oﬀ set   this disadvantage . furthermore , the need of new   treatment to show either great eﬃ   cacy or acceptability   than an exist standard therapy would serve as a   disincentive to the development of I -

lead cause of disability in the world and be project to rank first by 2030 [ 1 ] . depression be also associate with high rate of suicidal behavior and mortality[2 ] . treatment administer during the acute phase of a major depressive episode aim   to help the patient reach a remission state and eventually return to their baseline level   of functioning[3 ] . acute - phase treatment option include pharmacotherapy ,   depression - focus psychotherapy , combination of medication and psychotherapy ,   and somatic therapy such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ect ) . nevertheless ,   manage the acute phase of depression be only the first step in a long therapy process   that aim to maintain remission and prevent relapse . in this article , we discuss   various treatment option implement by clinician , highlight the role that each   option play in actual psychiatric practice . pharmacotherapy while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( ssris ) remain the gold - standard   treatment for depression , new antidepressant be always be develop and test .   the ultimate goal be to discover a molecule that exhibit quick effectiveness with as   few side effect as possible . daniel bovet study the structure of histamine ( the causative agent in allergic   response ) to find an antagonist , which be finally synthesize in 1937[4 ] . since then ,   many researcher have study the link between the structure and activity of   different antihistaminic agent , contribute to the discovery of almost all antide- pressants[5 ] . in the follow subsection , we list the main class of antidepressant in chrono- logical order of apparition , highlight the most widely use molecule in daily   psychiatric practice . monoamine oxidase inhibitor iproniazid be the first drug define as an antidepressant ; it be later classify as a   monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( maoi)[6,7 ] . several other maois have be introduce   since 1957[8 ] . due to their irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase , moais have   numerous side effect , such as hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crisis , that can lead to   lethal intracranial hemorrhage . consequently , maois have become less commonly   use over time[9 ] . trial have demonstrate that maois \\' efficacy be comparable to that of tricyclic   antidepressant ( tcas)[10,11 ] . however , consider maois \\' drug interaction ,   dietary restriction , and potentially dangerous side effect , they be now almost   exclusively prescribe for patient who have not respond to several other pharma- cotherapie , include tcas[9 ] . furthermore , maois have demonstrate specific   efficacy in treat depression with atypical feature , such as reactive mood , reverse   neuro - vegetative symptom , and sensitivity to rejection[12 ] . maois be also a potential therapeutic option when ect be contraindicated[13 ] .   maois \\' effectiveness be still unclear for treat depression in patient who be   resistant to multiple sequential trial with ssris and serotonin - norepinephrine   reuptake inhibitor ( snris)[14 ] . nevertheless , psychiatrist ’ use of maois have   decline over the years[15,16 ] . the use of maois be generally restrict to patient  karrouri r et al . mdd : validate treatment and future challenge wjcc https://www.wjgnet.com 9352 november 6 , 2021 volume 9 issue 31 who do not respond to other treatment . tcas the first tca be discover and release for clinical use in 1957 under the brand   name tofranil[5,17 ] . since then , tcas have remain among the most frequently   prescribe drug worldwide[9 ] . tcas - such as amitriptyline , nortriptyline , protrip- tyline , imipramine , desipramine , doxepin , and trimipramine - be about as effective as   other class of antidepressant - include ssris , snris , and maois - in treat major   depression[18,19 ] . however , some tcas can be more effective than ssris when use to treat hospit- alized patients[20 ] . this efficacy can be explain by the superiority of tcas over   ssris for patient with severe major depressive disorder ( mdd ) symptom who   require hospitalization[21 - 24 ] . however , no difference have be detect in   outpatient who be consider less severely ill[18,20 ] . in most case , tcas should   generally be reserve for situation when first - line drug treatment have failed[25 ] . ssris in december 1987 , a series of clinical study confirm that an ssri call fluoxetine   be as effective as tcas for treat depression while cause few adverse effect [ 26 ] . after be release onto the market , its use expand more quickly than that of   any other psychotropic in history . in 1994 , it be the second - well - sell drug in the   world[7 ] . currently available ssris include fluoxetine , sertraline , paroxetine , fluvoxamine ,   citalopram , and escitalopram . they have elicit different tolerance rate and side   effect - mostly sexual and digestive ( nausea and loss of appetite ) , as well as irritability ,   anxiety , insomnia , and headaches[27 ] . nevertheless , ssris have a good tolerability   profile[28 ] . in most systematic review and meta - analysis , ssris have demonstrate   comparable efficacy to tcas[18,19,29 ] , and there be no significant evidence indicate   the superiority of any other class or agent over ssris[29 - 31 ] . furthermore , study   show no difference in efficacy among individual ssris[29,31 - 34 ] . therefore , most   guideline currently recommend ssris as the first - line treatment for patient with   major depression[25 ] . norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor other monoamine ( norepinephrine , serotonin , and dopamine ) neurotransmitter   reuptake inhibitor call snris emerge during the 1990 to protect patient against   the adverse effect of ssris[35 ] . currently available snris be venlafaxine , desvenla- faxine ( the principal metabolite of venlafaxine ) , and duloxetine . the extend - release   form of venlafaxine be the most commonly use drug in this class . clinical guideline   commonly recommend prescribing snri to patient who do not respond to ssris[25 ] . in individual study , venlafaxine and duloxetine be generally consider effective   as ssris[36 ] . also , venlafaxine ’s efficacy be comparable to that of tcas[37,38 ] . accord to some meta - analysis , reboxetine ( a selective noradrenaline reuptake   inhibitor ) seem less efficacious than ssris[39 ] . however , these finding could be due   to the relatively poor tolerance of reboxetine[40 ] . other antidepressant trazodone be the old medication of the so -

moderate evidence indicate they be more effective than some other drugs[53 ] .   concern the acceptability of these drug , citalopram , escitalopram , fluoxetine ,   sertraline , and vortioxetine have be deem more tolerable than other antide- pressant , whereas amitriptyline , clomipramine , duloxetine , fluvoxamine , trazodone ,   and venlafaxine have the high dropout rates[53 ] because of their more frequent and   severe side effect . nausea and vomiting be the most common reason for treatment   discontinuation ; sexual dysfunction , sedation , priapism , and cardiotoxicity be also   reported[31,41 ] . ketamine and related molecule in intravenous sub -

dose treatments[36 ] , whereas prolong   exposure may predispose patient to neurotoxicity and drug dependence[56 ] . lastly ,   since ketamine be associate with a high risk of drug abuse and addiction , it can not   be recommend in daily clinical practice[59,60 ] . ketamine be not a miracle drug , and many important factor still need to be define ,   such as the most effective dose and the optimal administration route[61,62 ] . the   current lack of guideline about the therapeutic monitoring of ketamine treatment for   depression far complicate the expand use of this treatment[56 ] . even though   ketamine might never reach the market , it have stimulate research in the neurobiology   of depression , include study on potential fast and long - last antidepressant . ketamine have an active metabolite ( hydroxynorketamine ) that can produce rapid   and sustained glutamatergic stimulation . it also seem to be free of many of the safety   problem associate with ketamine and , thus , should be study . research on the s - enantiomer of ketamine ( s - ketamine , or esketamine , especially   intranasal ) could also be valuable , as it have a 3 to 4 time great affinity than ketamine   for the n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor[40 ] . it be approve by the united   states food and drug administration in march 2019 for treatment -

( be j psychiatry 2008 ; 165:342–351 ) patient with major depressive disorder often also suf- fer from anxiety , nervousness , and the somatic correlate of these state ( 1 ) . in patient with high level of anxiety accompany major depression , great severity of de- pressive illness and functional impairment ( 2 ) , great ill- ness chronicity ( 3 ) , and an increase risk of suicidality ( 4 ) have be report . although dsm - iv ( 5 ) do not recognize anxious de- pression as a diagnostic subtype , emerge evidence sug- gest a number of distinguish feature for this potential subtype ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) . in outpatient with major depression , early study report lifetime comorbidity rate of 40 % – 50 % ( 7 , 8) for anxiety disorder . more recently , in two dis- tinct large subsample of outpatient with major depres- sion in the sequenced treatment alternative to relieve depression ( star*d ) project ( 6 , 9 ) , the proportion with anxious depression ( those have a baseline 17 - item hamilton rating scale for depression [ ham - d ] anxiety/ somatization factor score ≥7 ) be in the range of 44 % – 46 % . in both subsample , patient with anxious depres- sion be significantly more likely to be unemployed , to have less education , to be more severely depressed , to have more concurrent anxiety disorder , and to report more melancholic / endogenous feature , even after ad- justment for severity of depression . previous research have also show that individual expe- rience major depressive disorder with high level of anx- iety symptom have a slow response to treatment ( 10 ) and , in some ( 11–13 ) but not all ( 4 , 14 ) short - term study , be less likely than those without high level of anxious symptom to respond to antidepressant treatment , re- gardless of the type of antidepressant use . the associa- tion between anxious depression and poor response to antidepressant treatment may account for the result of a study show that the concomitant use of anxiolytic or sedative / hypnotic be a significant predictor of treat- ment resistance in old adult with depression ( 15 ) . on the basis of the available literature , we hypothesize that patient with anxious depression would be signifi- cantly less likely than patient with nonanxious depres- sion to respond to , or achieve remission with , antidepres- sant treatment . we test these hypothesis by examinebe j psychiatry 165:3 , march 2008 343 fava , rush , alpert , et al . ajp.psychiatryonline.org treatment outcome with antidepressant treatment in pa- tient with anxious versus nonanxious major depression in level 1 and 2 of the star*d study . method study overview and organization the rationale , design , and method of star*d have be de- tail elsewhere ( 16 , 17 ) . briefly , star*d aim to determine pro- spectively which of several treatment would be most effective for outpatient with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who have an unsatisfactory clinical outcome with an initial treatment and , if necessary , subsequent treatment(s ) . participant be en- roll at 18 primary care and 23 specialty care setting across the united states . three -

tabulation of remission ( define with either the ham - d or the qid - sr ) with each possible threshold on the ham - d anxiety / somatization factor ( see supplementary figure 1 and 2 in the online supplement ) . from these analysis , it appear that the specificity drop off quickly . we also plot the number of anxiety symptom ac- cord to the ham - d anxiety / somatization factor versus the percentage of patient achieve remission as define by either the ham - d or the qid - sr criterion ( see figure 2 ; see also supplementary figure 3 in the online supple- ment ) . in general , one can observe a downward trend , with the remission rate dropping as the number of anxiety symptom increase . tolerability and side effect in level 1 , by   anxious versus nonanxious depression despite similar citalopram dosage in the two group and the long treatment exposure in the nonanxious de- pression group ( table 1 ) , the anxious depression group have great a frequency , intensity , and burden of side ef- fect than the nonanxious depression group , as well as more serious adverse event ( table 4 ) . notably , the num- ber of hospitalization for general medical condition be strikingly different between the two group : 40 among the patient with anxious depression compare with 18 among those with nonanxious depression . time to remission or response in level 1 , by   anxious versus nonanxious depression the time to first remission ( figure 3 ) and first response ( figure 4 ) differ significantly between the anxious and nonanxious depression group : those with nonanxious depression achieve remission and response soon on average than those with anxious depression . sample description of level 2 study participant in level 2 of star*d , 1,292 adult outpatient with major depressive disorder who have no remission of symptom in level 1 or could not tolerate citalopram ( in the case of the switch option only ) be randomly assign either to switch ( overall n=727 ) to sustain -

d anxiety / somati- zation factor be the good predictor , follow closely by the total score of the ham - d psychic and somatic anxiety item , and then by whether anxious depression be present ( as define by a ham - d anxiety / somatization fac- tor score ≥7 ) ; the bad predictor be whether any concur- rent anxiety disorder be present . although these datum and the relatively linear decline in remission rate with in- crease anxiety factor score ( figure 2 ) may seem to sug- g that the anxious / somatic factor should be view more as a continuous dimension than a dichotomous sub- type , one might argue that there be a certain clinical utility in the use of a threshold value and that the dichotomy per- form well enough in our regression analysis . in level 2 of star*d , patient with anxious depression be also less likely than those with nonanxious depres- sion to achieve remission , regardless of whether their level 2 treatment be a switch option or an augmentation option . this be the first time that a predictor of poor out- come with antidepressant treatment in a population with- out any prior history of treatment resistance have be confirm in a population with prospectively define re- sistance or intolerance to antidepressant treatment . the low ham - d remission rate observe in the anx- ious depression group could be due in part to residual symptom of anxiety , which may have increase the ham- d score , since this scale comprise several anxiety symp- tom item . on the other hand , low remission rate for anxious depression in both level 1 and 2 of star*d be also observe with the qid -

d do include anxiety item and its anxiety / somatization factor have be use in a number of previous study , it capture only a limited number of anxiety symptom . therefore , the possibility of a significant risk of misclassification can not figure 3 . time to remission in 2,876 patient in level 1 of star*d , by anxious versus nonanxious depressiona a log -

administer structured diagnostic interview , which might have provide a more accurate diagnostic picture . also , since only outpa- tient with major depression be enrol in the study , the clinical correlate and symptom pattern we find to be as- sociate with anxious depression may be different in inpa- tient treat for depression . furthermore , in the absence of a placebo control , we can not determine whether these patient be specifically less responsive to true drug effect or less responsive to the nonspecific aspect of treatment . in addition , participant be enrol from a number of site in a nonrandom manner . finally , patient with anxious depression have a high physical illness burden , low so- cioeconomic status , great severity of depression , and later onset of depression , all of which could themselves be associate with poor treatment outcome . it be possible that more severe or more difficult - to - treat form of depres- sion be accompany by high level of anxiety and there- fore that high level of anxiety in depression be simply an epiphenomenon of these other form of depression and do not represent a different subtype . similarly , it be possible that the great side effect burden in the group with high level of anxiety could be explain by the great number of general medical condition in this group . receive nov . 16 , 2006 ; revision receive march 20 , june 18 ,   and aug . 20 , 2007 ; accept aug . 27 , 2007 ( doi : 10.1176/ appi.ajp.2007.06111868 ) . from the depression clinical and research program , massachusetts general hospital , boston ; department of psychiatry , university of texas southwestern medical center , dallas ; epidemiology datum center , graduate school of public health , univer- sity of pittsburgh , pittsburgh ; university of illinois at chicago ; depart- ment of psychiatry , university of california , san diego , and san diego va medical center ; semel institute for neuroscience and human be- havior , ucla , los angeles ; and the department of psychiatry , univer- sity of pittsburgh medical center , pittsburgh . address correspon- dence and reprint request to dr . fava , depression clinical and research program , massachusetts general hospital , 55 fruit st . , bulfinch 351 , boston , ma 02114 ; mfava@partners.org ( e -
